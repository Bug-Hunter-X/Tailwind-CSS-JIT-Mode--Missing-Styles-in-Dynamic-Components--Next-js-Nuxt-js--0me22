# Tailwind CSS JIT Mode Bug in Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's JIT mode within dynamically generated components in Next.js or Nuxt.js applications. The problem arises because the JIT compiler may fail to correctly process and include the necessary CSS classes in certain runtime scenarios.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as missing styles or unexpected rendering behavior when components are generated dynamically.  Classes applied to elements might not take effect as expected, leading to styling inconsistencies.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server (as per your chosen framework's instructions).
4. Observe that the dynamically rendered elements do not get the expected Tailwind styles applied.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring Tailwind CSS properly processes the CSS classes within the dynamically generated content. This can often be achieved by re-evaluating the dynamic components or utilizing techniques to explicitly trigger Tailwind's JIT compilation process for those specific components.
